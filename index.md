Welcome — Personal Notes

1. Install Ruby, Bundler and the project gems:

```bash
bundle install
```

2. Serve locally (live reload):

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

This serves the site at http://localhost:4000 for quick previews.

Contributing and structure

- Notes live under `docs/` and are organized by topic folders. Files include simple front-matter (title/parent) so the theme shows them in the sidebar.
- If you keep working on these notes, add files, keep them brief, and link related pages for discoverability.

Thanks for visiting — use the sidebar to explore topics, or open an issue/PR on the repo if you want to suggest changes.
